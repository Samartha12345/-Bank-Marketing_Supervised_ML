Following data set contains following information:-
Given is the ‘Portugal Bank Marketing’ dataset:
Bank client data:
1) age (numeric)
2) job: type of job (categorical:"admin.","bluecollar","entrepreneur","housemaid","management","retired","self-employed","services","student","technician","unemployed","unknown")
3) marital: marital status (categorical: "divorced","married","single","unknown"; note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed)
4) education: education of individual (categorical: "basic.4y","basic.6y","basic.9y","high.school","illiterate","professional.course","university.degree","unknown")
5) default: has credit in default? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")
6) housing: has housing loan? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")
7) loan: has personal loan? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")
Related with the last contact of the current campaign:
8) contact: contact communication type (categorical: "cellular","telephone")
9) month: last contact month of year (categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", …, "nov", "dec")
10) dayofweek: last contact day of the week (categorical: "mon","tue","wed","thu","fri")
11) duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y="no"). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
Other attributes:
12) campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
13) pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
14) previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
15) poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "failure","nonexistent","success")
Social and economic context attributes
16) emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
17) cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)
18) cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)
19) concave points_se: standard error for number of concave portions of the contour
20) euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
21) nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)
Output variable (desired target):
22) y: has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: "yes","no")

Following are the tasks and models performed on given data set

1] Perform EDA on the given data. What does the primary analysis of several categorical features reveal
2]Perform the following pre-processing tasks: 
a. Missing Value Analysis
b. Label Encoding wherever required
c. Selecting important features based on Random Forest
d. Handling unbalanced data using SMOTE
e. Standardize the data using any one of the scalers provided by sklearn
3]Build the following Supervised Learning models: 🡪5 marks
	a. Logistic Regression
	b. Decision Trees
	c. Random Forest

4] Tabulate the performance metrics of all the above models, perform tuning of models and tell which model performs better in predicting if the client will subscribe to term deposit or not 

Conclusion from above models build:-
As the above problem statement we see the precision is more important for the predicting if the client will subscribe to term deposit. Random Forest is the best model as its accuracy is 91 % with precision of 57% and recall score of 72 % which is highest among all
